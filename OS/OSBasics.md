### **Interrupts**
- Interrupts are signals sent to the CPU by external devices (usually I/O devices). They make the CPU stop what it's currently doing to immediatly perform the requested action. Interrupts have three types:
    - **Hardware interrupt:** Generated by *hardware devices* to signal that they need attention from the OS. The device may have received data or completed some task requested to it by the OS, like transfering data between drives.
    - **Software interrupt:** Generated by programs when they want to request a system call to be performed by the operating system.
    - **Traps**: Generated by the CPU itself to indicate that some error or condition occured for which assistance from the OS is needed.

### **CPU Execution Mode**
A system call (syscall) will switch the *mode bit* to kernel mode, as well as traps and interrupts, but not application programs.

#### **User mode:** 
Restricted mode. Cannot execute certain instructions, access certain registers and I/O devices.

#### **Kernel mode:**
Also called Supervisor mode, has none of the above mentioned restrictions. Being able to execute and reference every instruction and memory locations.
